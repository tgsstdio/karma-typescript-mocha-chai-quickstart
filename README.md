# karma-typescript-mocha-chai-quickstart

 > A boilerplate dev environment for typescript, mocha & chai and karma for unit testing (tdd/bdd)

The node.js development environment has been set-up as a working example for writing and evaluating mocha & chai unit tests.
 
The purpose is to have the SAME mocha &amp; chai unit tests written in typescript or javascript using ES6 import ( common.js/node.js/webpack) AND then have those unit tests evaluated on the server side (node.js) and client side (via the Chrome browser) automatically by the Karma test runner.
